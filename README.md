# Manhattan Maker

-- This is an example that I will use to continue understanding ROR

Here are some things that I will include:
* Dependency Injection
* Integration Testing
* Unit testing
* Manhattans

This uses Ruby v 2.5.1 and all the latest Rails goodness

Eventually maybe I'll make a front end for it
